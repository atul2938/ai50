Probability:

world: ⍵
0 ≤ P(⍵) ≤ 1

 ∑ P(⍵) = 1
⍵→Ω
 
Unconditional Probability:
degree of belief in a proposition in the absence of any other evidence


Conditional Probability:
degree of belief in a proposition given some evidence is already revelaed to us

P(a|b) : what is the probability of a given b is true

Examples of conditional probability:
P(rain today|rained yesterday)
P(disease|test result)
P(route change|traffic conditions)

P(a|b) = P(a ^ b) / P(b)
