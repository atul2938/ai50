Propositional Symbols
P, Q, R
Logical Connectives
not, and, or, implication, biconditional

Model
Knowledge Base (information AI knows to be true or False)

Entailment
if Alpha entails beta
then if alpha is true then beta must therefore be true

infrence

Modus Ponens

Theorem Proving

initial state: starting knowledge base
actions: inference rules
transition model: new knowledge base after inference goal test: check statement we're trying to prove
path cost function: number of steps in proof
